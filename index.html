    <h1>Thank you so much for confirming your attendance at our wedding on<br>05.10.2025 at Château Mephis Kalaki, Georgia</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We’re beyond excited to celebrate this special day with you❤️</p>
      <p>Here’s everything you might need to know before the fun begins! We’ve done our best to make it all smooth sailing — just bring your lovely self and enjoy the ride!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Arrangements</h3>
      <p>We’ve got you covered! Your meals, overnight stay, breakfast the next day, and transport back to Tbilisi are all arranged by us. All you need to do is make your way to Georgia and the beautiful Château — we hope your travel there goes smoothly!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Gifts</h3>
      <p>Your presence truly means the world to us, that’s the best gift we could ask for. But if you’d like to give something, we’re currently saving for the renovation of our new home, so any monetary contribution would be incredibly appreciated. Since we’ll be traveling light, we kindly ask that you skip flowers or large physical gifts. Thank you for understanding!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Dress Code</h3>
      <p>To create a soft and dreamy vibe for the day, we’d love it if you dressed in natural and pastel tones, like the colors you see on this page. Think fresh, romantic, and relaxed. No stress if you can’t match exactly, the most important thing is that you feel good!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Entertainment</h3>
      <p>We’re hoping for a joyful, laid-back evening filled with laughter and fun. To keep things personal and playful, we’d love it if you (alone or with others!) prepared a short, fun contribution: a little performance, game, tradition, song, dance, quiz, speach, or anything else you enjoy. Please keep it around 10–15 minutes max, and let us know your idea by September 15th so we can plan the best timing for it! We’ll have two microphones and a screen ready for you. No pressure — it’s all just for fun and togetherness, and we’re so excited to see what you come up with!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Speeches & Toasts</h3>
      <p>To make sure everyone can enjoy the beautiful words shared, we kindly ask those preparing a speech in Russian to send it in advance to my sister Olga at <a href="mailto:oromanova547@gmail.com">oromanova547@gmail.com</a>. She will prepare English copies for our international guests. For spontaneous speeches — no worries at all! We'll have lovely people on hand to help with live translations.</p>
